      As an IT student, I have come to understand that technical knowledge alone is not sufficient for a successful career in 
      Information Technology (IT). In this website, I will share my perspective on the significance of soft skills in the 
      IT industry and how they have played a vital role in my journey as an IT student, contributing to my growth, employability, and future success.
    </pre> 
    <pre>
      Problem Solving and Critical Thinking: Soft skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking are essential 
      tools in the IT student toolkit. As I tackle complex assignments and projects, these skills enable me to analyze problems,
       break them down into manageable parts, and find innovative solutions. By honing my critical thinking abilities, 
       I am better equipped to approach challenges with a logical and analytical mindset, leading to improved problem-solving capabilities.
    </pre> 
    <pre>
      Adaptability and Lifelong Learning: In the fast-paced world of IT, adaptability and a thirst for lifelong learning are key. 
      Technology is constantly evolving, and as an IT student, I need to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and trends. 
      Soft skills related to adaptability allow me to embrace change and be open to new ideas, tools, and technologies. 
      By cultivating a mindset of lifelong learning, I can continuously improve my skills, remain relevant, and thrive 
      in the ever-evolving IT industry.
    </pre> 
    <pre>
      Time Management and Organization: As an IT student, juggling multiple assignments, projects, and deadlines is a common challenge. 
      Soft skills such as time management and organization are crucial for success. By effectively managing my time, setting priorities, 
      and organizing my workload, I can ensure that I meet deadlines and deliver quality work. These skills also help me maintain a 
      healthy work-life balance and reduce stress during demanding periods.
    </pre>
    <pre>
      Communication and Collaboration: Throughout my studies, I have realized the importance of effective communication and 
      collaboration. As an IT student, I frequently work in teams, participate in group projects, and engage with professors and
       industry professionals. Developing strong communication skills allows me to express my ideas clearly and concisely, 
       facilitating effective collaboration with my peers. This skill has also helped me build positive relationships and 
       foster a supportive learning environment.

    <p>Unlike Kazuha this is actually a character of Genshin Impact that I spent money to get in the game as I actually relate to this character in some ways
        she's a very stunning character and very powerful in her own right as she is depicted as a god of thunder in the game. Genshin Impact will be always in my top 3 in my list 
        of favorite games of al time.

    <p>Solo Leveling</p>
    <pre>
      I would say I'm one of the first of this manhwa when it was still at chapter 1 at Asurascans.com or at Manhwatop.com. This Manhwa is my first Manhwa that became a staple as one of the best Manhwas 
      in my opinion. It is a good read and has multiple endings and will soon have a sequel where the son of the main character Sung Jin Woo will be the 
      New Protagonist in the new webtoon Solo Leveling: Ragnarok. That webtoon is still mostly written in Korean with very few English MTL or Machine Translations. Nevertheless this Manhwa
      is a 10/10 for me in story, 8/10 in character build up and design wise will be 10/10.

    <p>I enjoy watching Anime since I was still a kid, especially sci-fi action anime like Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny, which are my 
      favorite animes since I was a kid. This img is for the upcoming new Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Freedom anime airing at Jan 24 I think that's the promised date of released.
